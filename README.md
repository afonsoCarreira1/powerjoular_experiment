## GraphDisplay.py
This file runs the powerjoular files stored in 4orch_fib or matrixMulFiles.

To run:


    python3 GraphDisplay.py dir programName j|c
    
- dir is the directory where the files are stored
- programName is the name of the program, for the moment only 2 options exist (Fib/MatrixMult)
- j|c is to choose the language of the program
